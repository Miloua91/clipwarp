## Elevator pitch

Ever get frustrated trying to share links or text between your desktop and phone? It's a common inconvenience we all face. You have a link on your desktop, therefore you'd think it would be easy to get it on your phone, but it's always more complicated than it should be.

That's where ClipWarp comes in. Install it on both devices, and youâ€™ll have a simple way to manage links and text across platforms without the extra steps.

An instance where you need to send a link to your device, screenshot from Expo documentation. If it's up to me, then I will definitely use ClipWarp.
